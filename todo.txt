Music Matching TODO:

- read Computer sound
- transform sound to 1-D signal (maybe 2-D or 3-D signal later?)
- do 1-D color mapping to sound

GUI-Changes:
- Sound Filters:
    - by volume/level
    - by certain frequency range (e.g. bass only)
    - logarithmic/linear
- Color Mapping:
    - color range
